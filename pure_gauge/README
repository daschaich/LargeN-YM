SU(N) pure-gauge density-of-states computations including evolution
Can use either over-relaxed quasi-heatbath or hybrid Monte Carlo for updates

For N=3 pg_ora reproduces milc_qcd/pure_gauge/test/su3_ora.2 (blame for test su3_ora.1 mentions "new random number generator" from commit c05e59d)

N=4 pg_ora seems strangely sensitive to roundoff accumulation --- HMC to be checked...
