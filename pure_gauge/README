SU(N) pure-gauge evolution and LLR density of states
Former uses either over-relaxed quasi-heatbath (ora) or hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC)
LLR uses HMC

For N=3 pg_ora reproduces milc_qcd/pure_gauge/test/su3_ora.2 (blame for test su3_ora.1 mentions "new random number generator" from commit c05e59d)
However, have noted and reported strange sensitivity to roundoff accumulation --- see github.com/milc-qcd/milc_qcd/issues/44

Sample input files are in the ../testsuite directory
