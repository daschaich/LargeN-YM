This directory provides a suite of tests for SU(N) lattice gauge theories with N=2, 3, 4

Reference input and output files are provided for the following compilation targets (which are described in ../clover_hmc/README, ../wilson_flow/README and ../pure_gauge/README):
su3_hmc
su3_hmc_spectrum
su3_Wflow
pg_ora

Depending on the fermion rep, each target may be tested for SU(N) gauge theory with different numbers of colors:
* N=2, 3 or 4 colors for the fundamental rep (2F, 3F, 4F)
* N=3 or 4 colors for the two-index-symmetric rep (2S, 3S, 4S)
* N=4 colors for the two-index-antisymmetric rep (3A, 4A)
The gauge configurations loaded by each test are also provided.  The choice of (beta, beta_frep)=(2.5, 0.5) for 3S is motivated by Table I in arXiv:1201.0935, the choice of (6, 0.5) for 4A is motivated by Table III in arXiv:1307.2425, and the choice of (5.4, 0) for 3F is motivated by arXiv:1606:01277.  We then scale beta~N^2 for other N.

Although the 3A rep is the same as the 3F rep, the output from these tests is not identical since the random gaussian pseudofermion components are generated in different orders.  Similarly the 2S rep is the same as the 2Adj rep that is not currently included in this package.

The scripts scalar/run_tests and mpi/run_tests automate the process of compiling, running and checking the given target for the given gauge group and fermion rep.  Each script must be run from its respective directory.  Given the four arguments
$ ./run_tests <target> <N> <dim_F> <rep>
the script will compile the target $target for gauge group SU($N) and $dimF-dimensional fermion rep $rep, run the $target executable using the appropriate input file in this directory, save the output to $tag.$N$pat.out and check for differences between this output and the reference file $tag.$N$pat.ref.  Here $target=su3_$tag and $pat=F, S or A as listed above.

Currently the MPI tests are customized for the HEP-TH cluster at the University of Colorado.  Adjusting the $makefile and $run variables at the start of mpi/run_tests may suffice to adjust the tests for other systems.

Current limitations:
Only anti-periodic temporal boundary conditions for the fermions are tested.
