MILC-based code for SU(N) lattice gauge theories with N=2, 3, 4

The original goal of this repo was to investigate determinant reduction for Wilson-clover fermions, so there are some legacy clover applications that may not be fully reliable

Top-level directories follow the MILC layout
generic        -- Procedures common to most applications: communications, I/O, data layout, pure-gauge computations, etc.
generic_wilson -- Procedures common to Wilson-fermion applications
generic_clover -- Procedures common to Wilson-clover applications
generic_nhyp   -- Procedures common to nHYP-smeared applications
include        -- Header files for common procedures
libraries      -- Single processor linear algebra routines

Then there are various application directories, each with more detailed READMEs:
clover_hmc -- Wilson-clover HMC with nHYP smearing and multilevel Omelyan integrator
pure_gauge -- Pure-gauge evolution using over-relaxed quasi-heat bath algorithm
wilson_flow -- Wilson flow with optional RG-blocking and measurements

Finally, the testsuite directory contains some sample input files and corresponding output for testing
